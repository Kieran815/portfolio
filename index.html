            After 20 years in Sales, it was time for something different. I began coding at the beginning of 2019 and have fallen in love. After 18 months of self-study, I have taken the jump and enrolled in MicroTrain's Agile Web Development Bootcamp. I am committed to becoming a Professional Web Developer. I started out making some pretty cool front-end apps with React, then started learning Gatsby. I mostly deploy with Firebase and have recently started learning how to deploy to Amazon Web Services. I love to rock a good JAM stack.
